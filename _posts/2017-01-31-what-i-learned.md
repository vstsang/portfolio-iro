title: What I've learned after 4 months of JavaScript with Bloc

After almost a quarter of the way into the Bloc full stack development program, I have discovered it is just as important to know how to learn than what to learn. Here are some of my thoughts during this learning experience:

* Using a structured curriculum
* Benefits of a mentor
* Write notes down using your own words as you learned
* Experiment in JSBin / JSFiddle / Repl.it

## Using a Structured Curriculum
I have learned an incredible amount of front end technologies after only being with Bloc part-time for 4 months, definitely more than I thought what would be possible at the beginning of the course. 

What amazed me even more was that I already have spent a substantial amount of time with Code School, Code Academy and Ruby on Rails Tutorials prior to Bloc, along with prior programming experiences in school days. Despite understanding bits of the code, I never felt I could actually build something on my own. 

The structured curriculum in Bloc have made a big difference in progressing my learning. I found the videos and exercises in Code School although fun to watch, they are too rigid within the platform to make me feel I have got a good grasp of the concepts.

## Benefits of a Mentor
Perhaps this is the biggest differentiator with Bloc compared to other programs, even comparing to formal classes in universities. The weekly meetings I have with my mentor allow me to ask things that are too difficult to ask on Stack Overflow and other forums. 

This is probably different with every Bloc students, but I have found I rarely ask strictly technical questions. Instead I have learned many things from my mentor that would not have been possible from reading forums or blogs. These include coding best practices and discussion on the best capstone project ideas. In fact having a mentor program is the primary reason I joined Bloc, perhaps this was the frustration that came from the many Code School and Rails tutorials I have done, but with no learning support.

## Write notes down using your own words as you learned - Rubber Duck or Feynman
Writing notes down as I learned has always been a habit of mine, the benefits are obvious. It also helps memory consolidation during revisions.

It is especially important to write notes down using your own words. This is the heart of the [Rubber Duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) or [Feynman learning techniques](http://mattyford.com/blog/2014/1/23/the-feynman-technique-model).

## Experiment in JSBin / JSFiddle / Repl.it
It is inevitable that you will get stuck during the development process. It is invaluable to use a sandbox environment (e.g. JSBin, JSFiddle or Repl.it) to periment with codes to understand how they work. This is particularly more so for DOM elements and loop counters. I use `console.log` to identify logic flow and variable values as part of the debugging process.

## Conclusion
I hope this short post would be of value to other students in the development learning journey. Although there is still a long road ahead for me, I do now think I have a good foundation for future learning and confident enough to build my own product in time.
