title: Class Responsibility Collaborator in 5 minutes
---

This topics deviates somewhat from my front end or JavaScript learning experience, but in preparation for my capstone project, I have been thinking about what the back end should be composed of. Although I have yet to reach the Ruby on Rails portion of the Bloc curriculum, it is almost a certainty that it will be based on Rails. 

During this process I have had discussion with my mentor on the best way to build the data model, so I have a clear idea of the objects and methods I need to build for the project, along with the relationship they have with each other. 

The data model forms the foundation of the backend. It maps out the database and the associations (Collaboration) the models have each other. It dictates what the objects (Class) and methods (Responsibility) should be. Therefore it is crucial this is done correctly in the first place, not to mention it should have the flexibility for amendments based on future business requirement changes. 

This is where Class Responsibility Collaborator comes in, or simply CRC cards.

## What are CRC cards
Class-responsibility-collaborator cards (CRC cards) is a data modelling technique to iteratively refine the Use Cases until the Classes, Responsibilities and their Collaborators become apparent. This is then used correspondingly to build the data model.

The technique involves using physical cards with each card representing a single class. Each card has the name of the class (objects) listed on top, its responsibilities (attributes and methods) below, and collaborators (association with other classes) on the side.

## How to develop CRC cards
Once the User Stories have been developed, it should be straight forward to iteratively refine this into CRC Cards. Basing on the User Cases:
1. Use the nouns to identify the classes
2. List the actions within the class as responsibilities
3. Link any associations between the classes as collaborators

Based on the User Stories, firstly identify the nouns within them to form the Classes. These may be customers or shopping carts. 

Then the actions these objects need to perform will become the responsibilities, these being checking current shopping cart content or checkout.

The associations between the objects then becomes the collaborators. Examples include each customer having only one shopping cart.

## Key to the CRC Process
An important aspect of the CRC process is using it as a brainstorming tool, this means refining the CRC card contents incrementally to support the User Stories. The CRC cards are intended to be physical cards and be moved around, so similar classes can be grouped or even consolidated together.

This encourages collaboration amongst the development team talking out the data model and how it supports the Use Cases.

## Conclusion
CRC Cards is a simple yet powerful data modelling technique for object oriented design and analysis. It bridges the gap between the Use Cases narrative and the structured data model during the development process.
